And he said to them,  <br>
“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

Behold, I have given you authority  <br>
to tread on serpents and scorpions,  <br>
and over all the power of the enemy,  <br>
and nothing shall hurt you. 

[20](# "ref")
Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this,  <br>
that the spirits are subject to you,  <br>
but rejoice that your names <br>
are written in heaven.”

In that same hour he rejoiced <br>
in the Holy Spirit and said,

“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,  <br>
that you have hidden these things <br>
from the wise and understanding <br>
and revealed them to little children;

yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.

All things have been handed over to me <br>
by my Father,

and no one knows who the Son is <br>
except the Father,

or who the Father is except the Son <br>
and anyone to whom the Son chooses <br>
to reveal him.”

[Luke 10:17-24 (ESV) (p.4/5)](# "ref")

Then turning to the disciples <br>
he said privately,  <br>
“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!  <br>

For I tell you that many prophets and kings  <br>
desired to see what you see, and did not see it,  <br>
and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.”
